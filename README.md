# Introduction

This is a PHP portfolio/resume website! This website showcases your work and allows visitors to get in touch with you through a contact form. The contact form includes email validation to ensure that the user is submitting a valid email address.

##Notes
The contact form uses the PHP mail() function to send the email. Make sure your server is configured to send emails using this function.
The email validation uses a regular expression to check that the email address is in a valid format. It is not a foolproof method and may not catch all invalid email addresses.
I hope this readme file helps you understand how to use and set up my PHP portfolio website with a contact form and email validation. If you have any questions or issues, please don't hesitate to contact me.
